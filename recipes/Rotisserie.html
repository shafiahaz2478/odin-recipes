            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Season chicken cavity with a pinch of salt. Tie legs together with kitchen string; then tie wings to the bird. Secure chicken on a rotisserie attachment.</li>
                <li>Place rotisserie over the preheated grill and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, quickly mix together butter, 1 tablespoon of salt, paprika, and pepper. Turn the grill down to medium and baste chicken with butter mixture.</li>
                <li>Close the lid and cook over medium heat, basting occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (83 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the rotisserie and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.</li>
